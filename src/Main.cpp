/*
Note:
Goal is to understand 
- how functions work with different type of inputs.
- how does return keywork effect the control flow.
- how does changing the argument values inside the function
  effect in the caller function.
- how binary operators work.
 
 In lessons, you will update the test cases with expected output.
 In exercises, you will update the function stubs with functionality.

Actions:
1. You need to fill in the blanks in lesson files under spec project.
 - L01_FunctionsSpec.cpp
 - L02_BitwiseSpec.cpp
 And DO NOT modify any functions in the lesson files in src project
 except the comments in three_things_i_learnt() function.
 - L01_Functions.cpp
 - L02_Bitwise.cpp

2. You need to implement the function stubs in exercise files in src project.
 - E01_Functions.cpp
 - E02_Bitwise.cpp
 And DO NOT modify anything in excercise files in spec project
 - E01_FunctionsSpec.cpp
 - E02_BitwiseSpec.cpp
