/*
Note:
Goal is to understand 
- how functions work with different type of inputs.
- how does return keywork effect the control flow.
- how does changing the argument values inside the function
  effect in the caller function.
- how bitwise operators work.
 
Structure:
The structure of the unit is it contains some lessons and exercises.
In lessons, you will update the test cases (spec) with expected output.
In exercises, you will update the function stubs (src) with functionality.

Actions:
1. You need to fill in the blanks in lesson files under spec project.
 - L01_FunctionsSpec.cpp
 - L02_BitwiseSpec.cpp
 By reading the code in lesson files under src project.
 - L01_Functions.cpp
 - L02_Bitwise.cpp
 And DO NOT modify any functions in the lesson files in src project
 except the comments in three_things_i_learnt() function.

2. You need to implement the function stubs in exercise files in src project.
 - E01_Functions.cpp
 - E02_Bitwise.cpp
 And DO NOT modify anything in excercise files in spec project
 - E01_FunctionsSpec.cpp
 - E02_BitwiseSpec.cpp
